# Java OOP Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It includes individual exercises for core concepts, a comprehensive Library Management System project, and two additional projects: Health Management System and Banking System.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main parts:

1. Core Concepts
2. Library Management System
3. Health Management System
4. Banking System

### Core Concepts

Located in the `src/coreconcepts/` directory, these files contain examples and exercises for fundamental OOP concepts.

### Library Management System

Located in the `src/librarysystem/` directory, this project combines all the OOP concepts into a practical library management application.

### Health Management System

Located in the `src/healthsystem/` directory, this project focuses on managing patient information, doctor details, and hospital operations.

### Banking System

Located in the `src/bankingsystem/` directory, this project covers the management of bank accounts, transactions, and customer information.

## How to Use This Project

1. Start by reviewing and practicing with the core concept files in the `coreconcepts` package.
2. Move on to the Library Management System project in the `librarysystem` package.
3. Explore the Health Management System project in the `healthsystem` package.
4. Examine the Banking System project in the `bankingsystem` package.
5. Try extending any of the projects by adding new features or modifying existing ones to reinforce your understanding.

## Key OOP Concepts Covered

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- Interfaces
- Singleton Pattern
- Collections (e.g., ArrayList)

## Project Descriptions

### Health Management System

This project focuses on managing patient information, doctor details, and hospital operations. It includes the following key classes and concepts:

- **Person** (Abstract Class)
- **Patient** (Subclass of Person)
- **Doctor** (Subclass of Person)
- **Hospital** (Singleton)
- **MedicalRecord** (Composition)
- **Appointment** (Composition)
- **Reservable** (Interface)

### Banking System

This project focuses on managing bank accounts, transactions, and customer information. It includes the following key classes and concepts:

- **BankAccount** (Abstract Class)
- **SavingsAccount** (Subclass of BankAccount)
- **CheckingAccount** (Subclass of BankAccount)
- **Customer** (Composition)
- **Transaction** (Composition)
- **Bank** (Singleton)
- **Interestable** (Interface)
- **Overdraftable** (Interface)

## Extending the Projects

You can further enhance these projects by adding more features, error handling, and user input/output management. Additionally, you can explore topics like exception handling, file I/O, and database integration to make these systems more robust and practical.
