# Java OOP Learning Project

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

1. Core Concepts
2. Library Management System
3. Health Management System
4. Banking System

### Core Concepts

Located in the `src/coreconcepts/` directory, these files contain examples and exercises for fundamental OOP concepts:

- ClassesAndObjects.java
- Encapsulation.java
- Constructors.java
- Inheritance.java
- Polymorphism.java
- Abstraction.java
- Interfaces.java
- StaticMembers.java

Each file focuses on a specific OOP concept and includes examples and exercises to practice that concept.

### Library Management System

Located in the `../librarysystem/` directory, this is a comprehensive project that combines all the OOP concepts into a practical application. The main files are:

- LibraryItem.java (Abstract class)
- Book.java
- DVD.java
- Reservable.java (Interface)
- ReservableBook.java
- Patron.java
- Library.java (Singleton)
- LibraryManagementSystem.java (Main class)

This project simulates a library system where you can manage books, DVDs, patrons, and perform operations like checking out items, returning items, and reserving books.

### Health Management System

Located in the `../healthsystem/` directory, this project focuses on managing patient information, doctor details, and hospital operations.

### Banking System

Located in the `../bankingsystem/` directory, this project covers the management of bank accounts, transactions, and customer information.


## Key OOP Concepts Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Static Members
- Composition
- Singleton Pattern

## Extending the Project

To further enhance the Library Management System:

- Implement a user interface (console-based or GUI)
- Add a fine system for overdue items
- Create different types of patrons (e.g., students, faculty) with different borrowing privileges
- Implement a search functionality for books by title or author
- Add a database to persist the library data
